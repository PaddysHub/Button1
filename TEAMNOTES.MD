  Something that we learned today which was helpful is that you can combine both focus and hover selectors rather than having them as two different psuedo elements. Our next steps are to meet up this week and continue working on our button, specifically working on the functionality of the button before we style the button with proper padding, borders, margins, etc.
Also learned proper formatting as well as how to attempt to reverse-engineer other code to impelement similar design methods.
