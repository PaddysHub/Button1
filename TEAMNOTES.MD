  Something that we learned today which was helpful is that you can combine both focus and hover selectors rather than having them as two different psuedo elements. Our next steps are to meet up this week and continue working on our button, specifically working on the functionality of the button before we style the button with proper padding, borders, margins, etc.
Also learned proper formatting as well as how to attempt to reverse-engineer other code to impelement similar design methods.

  Today we finished the rendering and constructor methods in out ButtonTag.js file. The functionality of the button works well and when clicked on brings the user to the website as intended. The only thing our group needs to do now is design the button to mimic the one on 'grey goose'.

  This weekend we finished designing the button in a way that mimics the one on grey goose. We made the button transparent and added a background photo using an image url. Additionally, we made the button so it changes color when hovering over the button (the hover object). This week, we plan on starting functional testing.

  Today in class we went over our code and made any neccessary changes. The changes we made were lower casing the "search" icon and adding icon as a property with type string. We are now planning on doing extra credit by adding sound to our button. During our cross-group collaboration, a group member from another group Frankie insisted we delete the unneccesary code at the bottom of our html file. Additionally,
  she said that we should edit the borders of our background to fit the whole screen.
